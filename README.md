## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up your environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env.local
   ```
   Then edit `.env.local` with your `DATABASE_URL`. For local development, you can use:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/ggbench
   ```

3. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   npm run setup-db
   ```
   This will create the database tables and an admin user (admin/admin123).

4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Admin Access

After running the setup script, you can log in as an admin:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

The admin panel will be available at `/admin` where you can:
- Add new LLM models with their API configurations and endpoints
- Add new prompts for animation generation
- Generate animations using the selected model and prompt
- View current models and their ELO rankings

## Database Migrations

If you're updating an existing database, run the migration to add the new `api_endpoint` field:

```bash
npm run migrate-api-endpoint
```

This will add the `api_endpoint` column to the models table for storing API endpoint URLs.

## Development

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## Deployment

This project is configured for deployment on Vercel. Simply connect your repository to Vercel and it will automatically deploy.
